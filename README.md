# Dynamic Form Generator

A dynamic form generator that creates forms based on JSON schemas. This project uses React, React Hook Form, and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-form-generator.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd dynamic-form-generator
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
To run the application locally, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application.

## Example JSON Schemas

Here is an example of a JSON schema that you can use to generate a form:

```json
{
  "formTitle": "Contact Form",
  "formDescription": "Please fill out the form below.",
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "name",
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Full Name",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "id": "email",
      "type": "email",
      "label": "Email",
      "required": true,
      "validation": {
        "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$",
        "message": "Please enter a valid email."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "company",
      "type": "select",
      "label": "Company",
      "required": false,
      "options": [
        { "value": "tech", "label": "Tech" },
        { "value": "finance", "label": "Finance" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "subscribe",
      "type": "radio",
      "label": "Subscribe to newsletter",
      "required": false,
      "options": [
        { "value": "yes", "label": "Yes" },
        { "value": "no", "label": "No" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "comments",
      "type": "textarea",
      "label": "Comments",
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```

This schema will generate a form with fields for a name, email, company selection, subscription choice (radio buttons), and comments (textarea).

## Local Development Guide

To develop this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-form-generator.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd dynamic-form-generator
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
Run the application in development mode with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 4. Modify the Schema
You can modify the JSON schema in the app to generate different forms. Update the JSON schema in the editor to change the form fields.

### 5. Testing the App
To test the form, you can use the included tests with Jest and React Testing Library. You can run the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the test suite and provide you with results, including test coverage.

## Deployment Guide (Vercel)

To deploy the app on Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and log in (or sign up).
2. Click **New Project** and link your GitHub account.
3. Select the **dynamic-form-generator** repository.
4. Vercel will automatically detect the project settings (React app) and deploy it.
5. Once deployed, Vercel will provide a live URL to your app.

### Access the Deployed Application
Once deployed, you can access your live application using the URL provided by Vercel.

## Additional Information

- **Test Coverage**: Jest and React Testing Library are used for testing. Ensure all critical components, such as the form field validation and submission, are covered by tests.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The app includes edge case handling for missing fields, invalid JSON input, and other potential form submission issues.
- **Contributions**: Feel free to fork this repository, submit pull requests, and contribute to improving the app.

### **How to Use This `README.md`:**
1. Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in the clone URL.
2. If you want to deploy it on a different platform (e.g., Netlify), you can modify the deployment section accordingly.
3. Ensure that the **Example JSON Schemas** section aligns with the actual schema structure you're using in your app.

This README is designed to give users clear instructions for setting up, testing, and deploying the app, as well as an understanding of how to use the dynamic form generator with JSON schemas.
